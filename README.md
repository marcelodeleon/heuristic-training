# Heuristic Optimization
The goal of the algorithm is to train an agent –by optimizing it's heuristic– to play "Cuanteti", 
a custom variant of the game of "Tateti". 

## Dependecies
Heuristic optimization developed in Python3.
Dependencies defined in requirements.txt

## Execute
Install dependencies (from project root):
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Execute heuristic optimization (from project root):
```
python3 heuristic_optimization.py
```

Run a game between agents (from project root):
```
python3 run_cuanteti.py
```
